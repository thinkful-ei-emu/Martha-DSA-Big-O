//Determine the Big O for the following algorithm:

/**
 * 1. A. You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to 
 * find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same 
 * breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 
 * people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up 
 * and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would 
 * like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - 
 * "I do, be happy to bring him over"
 * 
 * 
 * Answer:
 * Big O for this alogrithm would be O(1) or constant 
 * becuase you are asking the whole group and waiting 
 * for the response and only one person responded.
 * Questions:
 * Is this like an API call, you just wait for the response?
 */

/**
 * 1. B. You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want
 * to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same 
 * breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 
 * people have the same breed as your dog. You start with 
 * the first person and ask him if he has a golden 
 * retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, 
 * and the next, and the next until you find someone who 
 * has a golden or there is no one else to ask.
 * 
 * Answer: This is a linear O(n) run-time complexity you can think 
 * of this as an array of 15 people with dogs, you are using 
 * the alogrithm that checks each option in order until you 
 * find a match. While you could find it on the first try 
 * resulting in constant O(1), more likely you will have to ask 
 * multiple people. At that point the "number of operations" is 
 * proportional to the number of data.
